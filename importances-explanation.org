Explanation of Importances

An "importance" is a number assigned to a feature by a model.

What the number means depends on the model.

For elastic net models, the importance is the coefficient of the
linear model. It can be positive or negative. It's size is dependent
on the units of the feature. For example, if the feature is time and
is measured in seconds, the coefficient might be 0.1. If you have the
exact same model and time is measured in minutes, the coefficient
would be (0.1 / 60).

For random forests model, the importance is the fraction of decision
trees in which the feature is used to split a node in any of the
decision trees in the forest. It is between 0 and 1.

One use of the models' importances is to compare them with your
going-in hypotheses, and then to think through why there are
differences.
