Supposed the only feature we use is the oasspread from the trace
print records.

Here are the feature set we build up by lagging the oasspread one
trade.

id oasspread oaspread_back_1
1  101       None
2  102       101
3  103       102
4  104       103
5  105       104

What is the training data after we have seen id 5?

Answer part 1: the features are

2  102       101
3  103       102
4  104       103

Answser part 2: the targets are

2 103
3 104
4 105

Assertions:

1. There is no problem in using the oasspread as a feature and a
   target, as long as we don't peak at a future value.
   
2. Likewise, we can use the price as a feature when predicting
   the oasspread, even though there is probably a function that
   converts the price for a cusip into its oasspread.


How accurate is the model that was trained after having seen id 5?

Answer:

1. Use the model fitted after seeing id 5. It was trained on ids
   2, 3, and 4 and used the actual oasspreads for ids 3, 4, and 5.
   Call this model m.

2. Run m.predict(features for id 5). We have predicted the next
   oasspread.

3. Wait for id 6 to determine the actual oasspread.
